# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Overview
This project is a simple **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** built using **Python**, **MySQL**, and a **Tkinter-based GUI**. The system captures network packets, analyzes them for potential threats, stores detected intrusions in a MySQL database, and displays alerts in a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Packet Sniffing**: Captures network packets using Scapy.
- **Intrusion Detection**: Identifies suspicious network activities based on predefined rules.
- **Database Storage**: Logs detected intrusions into a MySQL database.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Displays alerts in real time using Tkinter.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- MySQL Server
- Required Python libraries:
  ```sh
  pip install scapy mysql-connector-python
  ```

### Database Setup
1. Start MySQL server.
2. Create a database named `nids_db`.
3. Update the `host`, `user`, and `password` in the script to match your MySQL credentials.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python nids.py
   ```
2. Click **Start Sniffing** to begin network monitoring.
3. Click **Show Alerts** to view detected intrusions.

## Customization
- Modify `suspicious_ips` in the script to add/remove suspected malicious IPs.
- Enhance detection rules by incorporating deeper packet analysis.
